Google Data Analytics Capstone Project (Exploratory Data Analysis on a fictional company)

## 1- ASK

# Introduction

 This Capstone project is the final project of my Google Data Analystics Courses. I will work for a fictional company as a junior data analyst. The company, Cyclistic is a real bike share company which has more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help to be organized and stay on the right lane. 


# Scenario

 I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# Characters and Teams 

Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.

Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels. 

Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. I joined this team 3 months ago and have been busy learning about how data process, clean and visualize. 

# Business Task
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
