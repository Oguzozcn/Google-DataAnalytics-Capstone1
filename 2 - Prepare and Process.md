## Prepare

I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The datasets of Cyclistic is a fictional company. This is public data that I can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But it has to be noted that data-privacy issues prohibit me from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
